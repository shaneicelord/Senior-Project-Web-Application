This is the CANS Tracking and Monitoring System. 
The project is built for Danielkids Memorial Foundation. 
The system tracks CANS Assessments (Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths) made for patients and visualizes patient progress at different levels (individual, by therapists, by department).
